Description
-----------

Data computed in connection to the article *Cohomology of moduli spaces via a result
of Chenevier and Lannes*, by Jonas Bergström and Carel Faber.

The notation follows that of the article. 

All Euler characteristics will have values in the Grothendieck group of $\ell$-adic absolute Galois representations. The $\mathbb S_n$-equivariant Euler characteristics will also keep track of the action of the symmetric group $S_n$ whose irreducible representations will be indexed in the usual fashion by Schur functions $s[\mu]$ with $\mu$ a partition of $n$.  

The file "M3n.txt" contains the S_n-equivaraint Euler characteristics of the moduli space of smooth n-pointed curves of genus 3 with n up to 14.

The file "Mbar3n.txt" contains the S_n-equivariant Euler characteristics of the moduli space of stable n-pointed curves of genus 3 with n up to 14.

The file "A3loc.txt" contains the Euler characteristics of all standard local systems on the moduli space of abelian 3-folds of weight at most 16.

The file "M3loc.txt" contains the Euler characteristics of all standard local systems on the moduli space of smooth curves of genus 3 of weight at most 14.
