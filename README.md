# M3A3interp

Description
-----------

Data computed in connection to the article *Cohomology of moduli spaces via a result
of Chenevier and Lannes*, by Jonas Bergstr√∂m and Carel Faber.

Details
-------

The notation follows that of the article. 
All Euler characteristics will be as elements in the Grothendieck group of ell-adic absolute Galois representations.  
The file "M3n.txt" contains the S_n-equivariant Euler characteristics of the moduli space of smooth n-pointed curves of genus 3 with n up to 14. 
The file "Mbar3n.txt" contains the S_n-equivariant Euler characteristics of the moduli space of stable n-pointed curves of genus 3 with n up to 14.
The file "A3loc.txt" contains the Euler characteristics of all standard local systems on the moduli space of abelian 3-folds of weight at most 16.
The file "M3loc.txt" contains the Euler characteristics of all standard local systems on the moduli space of smooth curves of genus 3 of weight at most 14.
